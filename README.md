# Project 3: Market Analysis Report for a National Clothing Chain 

## Objective
A national online clothing retailer is experiencing stagnant sales and wants to re-engage past customers through targeted marketing. The company aims to advertise one of three key products â€” **Shirt ($25)**, **Sweater ($100)**, or **Leather Bag ($1,000)** â€” but is uncertain which customers to target and with which product. Your task is to build a data-driven Power BI report that helps identify the optimal customer-product-location matches for a new campaign.

## Project Overview
This project involves data preparation, advanced DAX calculations, and visual analysis to generate personalized marketing insights. You'll use Power BI to create visuals that highlight customer trends and provide actionable recommendations for the company's marketing team.

## Data sources

- US Census Bureau </br>
Average income, location, population, industry</br>

- Business Data</br>
Product inventory, Product prices, Customer rating, Product return rate </br>

- Customer Data</br>
Customer ID, Names, Location, Date of birth, Purchase history</br>

-----
## Key Tasks

### 1. Data Preparation with Power Query
- Clean and structure the dataset using Power Query Editor.
- Apply custom M formulas for advanced data shaping where necessary.

### 2. Calculations with DAX
- Create a **calculated column** to generate a histogram of customer data.
- Develop DAX logic for column charts and analytical comparisons between product segments.

### 3. Data Visualization & Analysis
- Build and interpret the following visuals:
  - **Histogram** for customer frequency distribution
  - **Linear regression** chart for forecasting trends
  - **Scatterplot** with correlation coefficient (via card visual)

### Analysis Qestions

1. What is the correlation (R2 value) between sales and income?
2. What is the correlation (R2 value) between customer ratings and product return rate?
3. What are the linear regression formulas to predict customer income from customer sales?
4. Which customer do you predict has the highest income?
5. Which product will be advertised the most?

### Dashboard Preview

I have created three pages for the report. 

ðŸŸ  Income & Location insights
![1](Screenshots/1-Income-and-Location-Insights.png)
* There was no customer income data provided, and estimating it was one of the project tasks. I used linear regression based on customer purchase data and average state income data from the U.S. Census Bureau to make the estimates.
  
ðŸŸ£ Customer Insights

* I added calculated columns for outliers and Z-scores to use for the analysis and visualizations.

ðŸ”µ Product Insights

* The provided sales data spans only six months (September to March), which limits the ability to conduct a comprehensive seasonal analysis. As a result, demand forecasting and product recommendations may be biased toward colder months, missing important insights from spring and summer seasons. To demonstrate Power BI functionality, I generated basic product recommendations using predicted customer income and product pricing. However, incorporating regional weather data could have enabled a more detailed and accurate production recommendation aligned with seasonal demand.

## Additional Drill-through page
After passing the project assessment, I created a drill-through page to leverage industry and sales data, providing more detailed and transparent insights for each state. To build the KPI visualization, I first grouped the sales data into daily summaries by state. Then, I merged the queries and created one DAX measure to show the latest Monthly sales for each state, and another to caluculate each state's highest-ever Monthly sales, which I used as a sales target.

## Reflection

If I had more time, I would have enhanced the dashboards by incorporating weather data to explore potential correlations and by adding more user-friendly slicers to improve interactivity. While the current version captures the core insights effectively, these additions could provide a more comprehensive and engaging user experience.
